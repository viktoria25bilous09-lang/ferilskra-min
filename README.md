# ferilskra-min

This repository contains a minimal static resume site.

Files added:

- `index.html` — the resume page with sections (summary, experience, education, skills, projects).
- `styles.css` — responsive and print-friendly styles.

Quick preview:

Open the `index.html` file in your browser, or serve the folder and visit http://localhost:8000

To serve locally using Python 3:

```bash
cd /workspaces/ferilskra-min
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

Next steps:

- Replace the placeholder content in `index.html` with your real name, contact info, and experience.
- Optionally export to PDF using the browser Print → Save as PDF flow.
- I can help deploy this to GitHub Pages, Netlify, or generate a downloadable PDF.
